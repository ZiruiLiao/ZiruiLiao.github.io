We consider the cooperative situational awareness (CSA) problem of multi-UAV system crossing three-dimensional obstacle belt without any priori information of obstacles. The main contributions are: (1) A CSA method of multi-UAV system is developed to improve the accuracy of information acquisition; (2) Multiple uncertainties are modeled and characterized; and (3) The conventional D-S evidence theory is modified to solve high evidence conflict. Pearson coefficient is utilized to measure the correlation between evidence and define the credibility. Subsequently, the uncertainty based on interval probability is introduced to modify the reliability and obtain the weight. Lastly, the original evidence is weighted and averaged, and the D-S combination rule is adopted for synthesis. Compared with other improved methods, our method can identify the correct propositions more accurately.
