In this brief, the resilient consensus problem for multi-agent systems (MASs) is addressed based on the dynamic event-triggered (DE) mechanism, when the network is subject to malicious attacks. A dynamic variable is introduced in the DE mechanism to adjust the threshold dynamically. Via the proposed dynamic event-triggered mean-subsequence-reduced (DE-MSR) algorithm, all cooperative agents are guaranteed to reach an agreement on the same consensus value, so that the MAS achieves resilient consensus despite the influence of some noncooperative agents in the network. Compared to existing event-based resilient algorithms, the proposed DE-MSR algorithm is superior in reducing communication overheads while maintaining a resilient consensus. Finally, a comparative case study is conducted to validate the theoretical findings.
