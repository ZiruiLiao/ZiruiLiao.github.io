In recent years, situation awareness has been an essential research subject in the field of low altitude combat. However, previous work mainly focused on single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection, while it may obtain inaccurate information about the environment due to the limited detection ability and uncertainty of single airborne sensor. By contrast, this paper considers the cooperative detection of multi-UAVs and proposes a cooperative situation awareness method on the basis of multi-sensor information fusion. Firstly, obstacle information is detected and obtained by multiple airborne sensors considering the sensorsâ€™ uncertainty. Subsequently, D-S evidence theory is introduced to conduct the information fusion of obstacle with high confidence and more accurate obstacle coordinates are obtained. Next, the simulations of information fusion are conducted under fixed and flexible formations. Eventually, numerical results verify the validity of the proposed information fusion method, which can perceive the situation more accurately and reach at most 96.58% degree of confidence in a specific formation, thus achieving a precise cooperative situation awareness.
