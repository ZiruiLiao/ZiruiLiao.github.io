Based on a novel dynamic event-triggering mechanism, this work studies the resilient consensus problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) consisting of first-order and second-order agents. An internal dynamic variable is introduced to adjust the triggering threshold flexibly and facilitate the construction of the dynamic event-triggering condition (DETC). Subsequently, a heterogeneous dynamic event-triggering mean-subsequence-reduced (HDE-MSR) algorithm is developed, which ensures that the positions of all healthy agents achieve consensus on the same value and the velocities of all healthy second-order agents asymptotically approach zero. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to validate the theoretical findings.
